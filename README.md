Small exercise: HttpServer accepting multiple http requests and concurrent access to shared resources.
With no Frameworks, no Dependency Injection, no external libraries.

The HttpServer has to be com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer.


The application simulates a service that stores the highest scores of multiple users. Those are communicated through http requests.
